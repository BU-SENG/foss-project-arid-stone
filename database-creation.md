 ### Database Setup by Davis

I created the Supabase database for the project.  
I set up the tables and configured the required API keys needed for the application to communicate with the backend.

This includes:
- Setting up the project in Supabase
- Getting the Project URL and Anon Key
- Creating the initial database structure
